This app displays available foods and allows foods to be added, updated or deleted.

Clicking on a food opens a modal view where food properties can be modified, however, the modal's form isn't executing event.preventDefault(); in food.js, line 14; why not? This is my main problem.

In food.html the "ui sticky" is yielding the error "Sticky element is larger than its container, cannot create sticky." to the console and I'm also not sure why?
